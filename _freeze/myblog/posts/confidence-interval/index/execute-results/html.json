It's very impractical to measure average height of all adults. So you take a sample of 100 adults and measure their average height to be 5'7 inches. Now you know that this is just a estimate and if you took another sample, you might get different average. So how can you express the uncertainty around your estimate?\n\n## Confidence Intervals\n\nA confidence interval is a range of values, derived from the sample data, that is likely to contain the true value of an unknown population parameter. For example you can say you are 95% confident that the average height of all adults is between 5'5 and 5'9 inches. This is 95% confidence interval.\n\n## How to calculate\n\n$$\n\\bar{x} \\pm z\\cdot \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\bar{x}$ = sample mean, $s$ = sample standard deviation, $z$ = confidence level value and $n$ =sample size\n\n::: {#6104975d .cell execution_count=1}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom scipy.stats import norm\n\n# Example data\ndata = np.random.normal(loc=5.8, scale=0.5, size=100) \n\n# Calculate mean and standard deviation of the sample\nmean_value = np.mean(data)\nstd_dev = np.std(data)\n\n# Calculate the standard error of the mean (SEM)\nsem = std_dev / np.sqrt(len(data))\n\n# Calculate the margin of error for a 95% confidence interval\nmargin_of_error = norm.ppf(0.975) * sem\n\n# Calculate the confidence interval\nconfidence_interval = (mean_value - margin_of_error, mean_value + margin_of_error)\n\n# Plotting the data\nplt.hist(data, bins=20, alpha=0.7, color='#39729E', edgecolor='black', label='Sample Data')\n\n# Plotting the confidence interval\nplt.axvline(x=confidence_interval[0], color='grey', linestyle='--', label='95% Confidence Interval')\nplt.axvline(x=confidence_interval[1], color='grey', linestyle='--')\n\n# Adding labels and title\nplt.xlabel('Height')\nplt.ylabel('Frequency')\nplt.title('95% Confidence Interval for Adult Height')\n\n# Adding legend\nplt.legend()\n\n# Show the plot\nplt.show()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/cell-2-output-1.png){width=585 height=449}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Interpretation\n\nSaying \"I am 95% confident that the average height is between 5'5 and 5'9 inches\" doesn't mean that there is 95% chance that the true average falls in this range. Instead it means that if you were to take many samples and compute a 95% confidence interval for each one, about 95% of these intervals would contain the true average height.\n\n## Choosing CI\n\nIn order to choose confidence interval you should look into consequences of being wrong, if consequences are severe you might choose 99% CI else 95% is very common.\n\n> Higher CI level results in wider intervals and vice versa. So there is always a trade off between precision and confidence.\n\n## Limitations\n\nCI assumes that your data is normally distributed but which may not always be the case.\n\n",
