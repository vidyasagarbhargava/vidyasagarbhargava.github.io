Recall calculates the percentage of correct predictions for the positive class out of all positive predictions that could be made. \n\n\nThe F-measure or F score, also called as F1 score is calculated as the harmonic mean of precision and recall, giving each the same weighting.It allows a model to be evaluated taking both the precision and recall into account using a single score, which is helpful when describing the performance of the model and in comparing models.\n\n::: {.column-margin}\n$$\nF_{1}=2.\\frac{{precision} \\times {recall}}{{precision} + {recall}}\n$$\n:::\n\nThe Fbeta-measure is a generalization of the F-measure that adds a configuration parameter called beta. A default beta value is 1.0, which is the same as the F-measure. A smaller beta value, such as 0.5, gives more weight to precision and less to recall, whereas a larger beta value, such as 2.0, gives less weight to precision and more weight to recall in the calculation of the score. \n\n::: {.column-margin}\n$$ \nF_{{\\beta}} = \\frac{(1 + {\\beta}^2). (precision.recall)}{({\\beta}^2.precision+recall)}\n$$\n:::\n\n**Summary**\n\n* Precision and recall provide two ways to summarize the errors made for the positive class in a binary classification problem.  \n* F-measure provides a single score that summarizes the precision and recall.  \n* Fbeta-measure provides a configurable version of the F-measure to give more or less attention to the precision and recall measure when calculating a single score.\n\n",
