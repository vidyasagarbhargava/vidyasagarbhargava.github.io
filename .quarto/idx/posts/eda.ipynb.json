During hypothesis generation we look for factors which influence our dependent variable. EDA helps in confirming and validating those hypothesis.\n\nIt helps to find out unexpected pattern in data which must be taken into account, thereby suggesting some changes in planned analysis.\n\nIt helps in delivering data driven insights to business stakeholders by confirming they are asking the right questions and not biasing the investigation with their assumptions.\n\n### How to EDA\nI divide exploratory data analysis in 3 parts of investigation. \n\n1. *Structure Investigation* : Exploring shape and as well as data types.  \n2. *Quality Investigation* : To check general quality of datasets in regard to duplicates,missing values and unwanted entries.  \n3. *Content Investigation* : More indepth study of features and how they relate to each other.  \n\n### Example Case\n\nLet's download some data and perform eda to bring insights as well know quality of the data.\n\n### Structure Investigation\n\n### Structure of Non Numerical Features\n\n### Structure of Numerical Features\n\n### Quality Investigation\n\n### Missing Values\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":true,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"jupyter"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":false,"code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../styles.css"],"toc":true,"output-file":"eda.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"0.9.518","theme":["journal","../theme.scss"],"mainfont":"Atkinson Hyperlegible","backgroundcolor":"#e6ddde","title":"Exploratory Data Analysis ","description":"A way of summarizing, interpreting and visualizing the information hidden in rows and column format.","author":"Vidyasagar Bhargava","date":"06/11/2019","categories":["eda","python"],"jupyter":"python3","title-block-banner":true},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
